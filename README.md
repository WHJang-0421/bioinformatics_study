## Identification of SNPs in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein
We anaylzed variants in 40939 SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein amino acid sequences, and created a random forest classifier, predicting the sequence's location.

## Languages and Environments
We used python to preprocess our data, and R to build the random forest.
The scripts were written and executed via VSCode and RStudio in a conda environment.
